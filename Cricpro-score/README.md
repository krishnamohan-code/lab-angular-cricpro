# ProGrad Lab | Angular - CricPro

## Introduction

We are gonna be recreating our CricPro Cricket DashBoard using Angular.

## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Create a static Angular application with Angular CLI.
- Build an Angular application with one component.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone this repo.

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Navigate to your repo and create a pull request from your master branch to the original repository's master branch.

In the pull request name, add your Prograd id, name, and last name separated by a dash "-".

## Deliverables

You need to generate the starter code and fill it with the necessary code to satisfy the requirements described below.

## Starter Code

To generate the starter code, follow the steps given below

- To create a new application,
    - Open your ubuntu or cmd terminal and execute the following command
      - ```ng new app-name```
      - for example, ng new super-wars
    - To create a new component, execute the command 
      - ``` ng generate component component-name```
      - example, ng generate component contacts
      
## How to run

- To run the project go to your ubuntu terminal or VScode editor
    - open the ubuntu or cmd terminal or inside the vscode editor
    - run the command following command
    - ```ng serve --open or ng serve -o```
    

## Progression #1: 

In the first iteration, we are going to build a cricket scoreboard. You do remember it right! It's the first ever lab you have done as a ProGrad. Now let us try and build the same one with the help of Angular.

We will build this scoreboard in the `AppComponent` component. The scoreboard will have multiple players and their scores, Once you have tabulated the scores, create a pop up which opens up on clicking a player's name. and **it's not necessary to have an array to store these values**.

Easy, right? Add some styles to the page to give your score board a little flair!

Once you have tabulated the scores, create a pop up which opens up on clicking a player's name.
